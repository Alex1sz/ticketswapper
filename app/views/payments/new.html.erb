    <p>SwapStubs requires a $6.99 Service Fee for processing and servicing your transaction. The $ 6.99 Service Fee covers the total cost of service for both users in the deal. Either person in the deal is able to pay the Service Fee, but the fee must be paid in total and cannot split. </p>
    <p>Please Submit Service Fee, after you have sent your ticket exchange agreement to service@swapstubs.com.</p>
    <p>Payment of the service fee authorizes SwapStub to verify your tickets, and process each users transfer of tickets. The Service charge is non refundable. Please direct any questions to <a href="mailto:service@swapstubs.com">service@swapstubs.com</a></p>
