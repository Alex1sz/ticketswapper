        <p> List your available tickets! Site visitors contact the lister via email. Once an agreement is made, forward the agreement to <a href="mailto:service@swapstubs.com">service@swapstubs.com</a> and transfer the tickets to <a href="mailto:service@swapstubs.com">service@swapstubs.com</a>. SwapStubs receives each user's transfer, and verifies the tickets match the agreed to tickets before acceptance.</p>
        <p>SwapStubs does not accept either user's transfer to SwapStubs until both transfers arrive and are verified. Post verification, SwapStubs transfers the tickets to the new owners, and the transaction is complete. </p>
